            <h1>An Evolution Inspired by Clients</h1>
            <p>As a private, independent, employee-owned investment manager, Palm Alliance Management has the freedom to focus exclusively on investing for our clients for the long term. As such, we are deeply attuned to each client’s unique combination of investment goals, risk tolerance, and income and liquidity requirements, and we can act in partnership to address them as they change over time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inherent in this culture of partnership is a commitment to innovation, a firm-wide drive to uncover new solutions as markets and client needs evolve. Not merely innovation for its own sake, but rather the development of transformative concepts rooted in practical client applications. Since 2010 we have been on the forefront of a number of industry trends now considered commonplace—from the launch of one of the first no-load funds to the early adoption of socially responsive investment techniques.</p>
            <p>Our commitment extends beyond our lineup of investment products. We look to collaborate with clients to overcome a variety of challenges, be it a corporate pension plan trying to better match assets and liabilities or an investment advisor interested in evolving their practice. We are proud to be a thought partner to our clients, offering access to our investment professionals, both in person and through our thought leadership publications, training and joint research projects.</p>

            <h1>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</h1>
            <p>Palm Alliance Management by design attracts individuals who share a passion for investing and who thrive in an environment of rigorous analysis, challenging dialogue, and professional and personal respect. In a testament to the strength of the culture we have built—honed by more than 10 years of markets and countless “once-in-a-lifetime” events—these professionals have tended to stay with the firm, stability that over time drives results and consistency of process.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Our portfolio managers have worked in asset management for more than 25 years on average, some of it at Palm Alliance Management. And while our clients benefit from the wisdom of our seasoned professionals, we are always looking to supplement their ranks with emerging talent; by enabling the transfer of knowledge, providing growth opportunities for skilled investors and building thoughtful succession plans, we seek to ensure a consistent client experience over the long term.</p>
            <p>We believe our disciplined approach to diversification and strict adherence to focused investment criteria give our partners access to a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality opportunities in a low-cost investment vehicle. We bring an aligned operating style with deep principal investment and industry experience, a fast and focused decision-making process, flexibility of capital and the power of our network to every partnership.
                Since 2010, we try to live up to those principles. We value experience but have an eye for innovation. Our culture is strong; our teams are independent. Company fundamentals and client objectives are what drive us, not the noise of the markets. That is the art of investing, the art of partnership, the art of service.</p>

            <p>Our portfolio management professionals are critical, independent thinkers who benefit from being part of a global, diverse investment organization composed of more than 300 investment professionals with different perspectives on markets, economies and strategies. Clients benefit from the firm’s intellectual capital across investment disciplines—equity and credit, public and private, long and short, large and small—as our breadth of perspective bolsters individual conviction and often results in portfolios with high active shares and the potential for alpha generation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We continue to value the free exchange of ideas in pursuit of insight that might otherwise go undiscovered. We host multiple forums in which our investment professionals can share research, test theories and expose to scrutiny their investment ideas. These include both formal assemblies—such as our various asset class investment committees and the cross-class Asset Allocation Committee, along with our various research teams—as well as informal connections initiated by like-minded professionals with a shared dedication to the pursuit of investment insight on behalf of clients.</p>

                    <p>We have significant investments in real estate, renewable power, infrastructure and private equity across four countries in South America.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In Brazil, where we have been investing for 8 years, we are one of the largest real asset investors. We have $6 billion in assets under management across 20 states, including Arteris, a concession of nine toll roads; RDM, an integrated logistics solutions company; and NTS, a 2,000-kilometer gas distribution operator.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We also own a portfolio of 11 high-end, prime commercial properties in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 2017, we acquired NDK Ambiental, one of the largest private company operating water and wastewater systems, which serves approximately 15 million people. We began operations in Colombia in 2011 with an electrical distribution business, and in 2016 we acquired Isagen S.A., one of Colombia’s largest power generation companies. The same year we acquired a 57% stake in Rutas de Lima, a road concession in Peru.</p>

            <h1>A Centralized Resource, a Firm-wide Responsibility</h1>
            <p>Risk management has been central to Palm Alliance Management's investment culture since our founding in 2010. As an employee-owned manager, everyone at Palm Alliance Management is invested in identifying and managing risk—risk to our clients, risk to our portfolios, risk to our reputation.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We believe that fostering an environment of strong internal control is vital. To this end, we have established a rigorous risk management framework that features dedicated investment and operational risk teams who work to protect client assets and our reputation. Our risk professionals act as an independent complement to each investment team’s portfolio construction process, driving investment and operational risk reviews in collaboration with other control units of the firm, such as information technology, operations, legal and compliance, asset management guideline oversight and internal audit. With our Chief Risk Officer reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer, our risk management structure is enhanced by an ability to escalate issues as necessary to firm leadership as well as our fund boards and firm board of directors.</p>

            <h5>ESG INVESTING</h5>
            <div class="overview-long-line"></div>
            <h1>A Purpose-driven Investment Approach</h1>
            <p>Palm Alliance Management believes that material environmental, social and governance (ESG) characteristics are an important driver of long-term investment returns from both an opportunity and a risk mitigation perspective. We also understand that for many of our clients the impact of their portfolio is an important consideration in conjunction with investment performance.
                We consider the integration of ESG factors into the firm’s strategic plans to be consistent with our mission statement and overall investment culture.  <br> From our first application of “avoidance screens” to the launch of our Sustainable Equity Investment, Palm Alliance Management has been at the forefront of advancing the integration of ESG characteristics into investment processes.
                Today, we continue to build upon this legacy, driven by our belief that ESG factors, like any other factor, should be incorporated in a manner consistent with the specific asset class and style of each investment strategy.  <br> Palm Alliance Management collaborates closely with our clients and industry peers to build awareness and encourage broader disclosure. Across our investment platform, Palm Alliance Management looks for opportunities to engage on ESG issues and trends, and to support clients to increase the impact of their investments. We measure our success through sustained improvement in our ESG expertise. <br>ESG investing can be employed in a variety of ways to help generate enhanced returns as well as to implement non-financial objectives within a portfolio. We believe our approach not only benefits our clients, but can also support better-functioning capital markets and generate positive impacts for the world as a whole. </p>
