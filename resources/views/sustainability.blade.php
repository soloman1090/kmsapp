                    <h1>A mix of investments is typically better than one</h1>
                    <p>Asset allocation and diversification can help you strike the right balance between risk
                        and return in your portfolio. Holding a broad range of investments can help lessen the
                        impact that any one economic or market event will have on your portfolio. That’s because

                        <h1>A healthy mix</h1>
                        <p>Asset allocation refers to the different weightings of stocks, bonds and cash in your
                            portfolio. Because these three asset classes have tended to have varying rates of
                            return and risk profiles, asset allocation plays a role in helping you achieve your
                            investment goal.<br> <br>Diversification takes this process one step
                            further by spreading your money across different investments within the same asset
                            class. Rather than trying to figure out which type of stock or bond will perform
                            best, you’ll invest in many types. Over time, the ups of one investment have the
                            potential to balance out the downs of another, with the goal of reducing the risk
                            level in your portfolio. </p>

                    <p>Asset allocation can have a big impact on your portfolio’s rate of return. In general,
                        stocks are riskier than bonds, though most investors may need both. Your investment
                        goal, risk tolerance and time horizon help determine the best asset class mix for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because the asset classes don’t typically grow at the same rate, you’ll need to
                        periodically rebalance your portfolio. Rebalancing helps maintain your intended asset
                        allocation. Many investment firms offer the option of signing up for automatic
                        rebalancing.</p><br>

                    <p>It’s hard to diversify by geography, size and industry using individual investments.
                        That’s why so many investors rely on mutual funds. It would take a lot of time and
                        resources to construct a portfolio similar to a mutual fund’s.</p>
                    <p>A typical stock fund holds 75 to 100+ different investments. And the investment minimum
                        for most bond mutual funds is usually less than what you’d need to purchase a single
                        bond.</p>
