                <h2>Infrastructure Opportunities Are Evolving</h2>

                <p>
                    Historically infrastructure was narrowly defined as assets needed for the movement of people and physical goods, with focus on transportation and fossil fuels. This definition has evolved to today include more modern infrastructure, assets that incorporate the delivery of data and services, with a focus on digitization and energy transition. While the type of assets considered to be infrastructure has evolved, the key characteristics of infrastructure have remained more constant -- defensive and contractual cash flows, resiliency through economic cycles, incumbency advantages, and a critical role in society.
