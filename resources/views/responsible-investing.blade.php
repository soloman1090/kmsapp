                        <p>Many factors may impact the long-term performance of your investments; that’s why it’s important to responsibly approach every decision regarding your funds. Our investment programs are designed to enhance your financial resources while taking into account, where appropriate or practicable with respect to a particular investment, the potential effects of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These are at the core of the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Commonfund is proud to be a signatory to the PRI since 2013.  Additionally, Commonfund supports the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). </p>

Those third-party investment advisors are generally directed to vote proxies on behalf of their clients in a way that is consistent with Commonfund OCIO's or CF Private Equity's respective proxy voting policy. Both policies note that TCF is a signatory to the PRI and that, as such, Commonfund OCIO and CF Private Equity, as the case may be, believes that ESG factors and RI can materially impact investment performance. Accordingly, Commonfund OCIO and CF Private Equity, as applicable, asks those investment advisors to consider whether ESG factors and RI are material to the investment performance of the company in question and, if so, to support proposals addressing such factors when those factors are material.</p>

                                   <p>Commonfund operates within a rapidly changing regulatory and compliance environment where news of enforcement actions appear seemingly every day.  Compliance, like risk management generally, is embedded into the culture at Commonfund, led by our experienced legal and compliance teams.  Outside of Commonfund we seek to ensure that all of our managers, vendors and third party partners have regulatory and compliance people, processes and procedures that are as robust as our own.</p>

                                   <p>Some risks that institutions face may not result in direct financial consequences, but rather expose the institution to negative effects on their reputation.  Commonfund is always cognizant of the impact our decisions may make on the reputations of our clients and our firm.  Reputational harm can arise from negative press or damage to the perception of an institution among the public or within the institution’s operating community.</p>
                                   <p>The true and ultimate risk our clients face is the potential inability to continue pursuing their missions.  Commonfund takes all of the above risks into consideration when helping clients devise the appropriate investment policies and long-term strategies that will ensure their continued ability to execute in an uncertain future.</p>
